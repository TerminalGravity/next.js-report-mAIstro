They can upload or update workflows that integrate with both ADR systems and the vendor‚Äôs services.
After an internal review, the workflows become available to selected ADR departments.
This allows external partners to collaborate without exposing the entire internal marketplace.
8. Rewards Program Data Scientist: Advanced Analytics & ML
As a Rewards Program Data Scientist, I want to create a specialized machine learning pipeline that predicts user redemption behaviors and offers personalization.
I publish a ‚ÄúUser Redemption Prediction‚Äù workflow to the private marketplace, which includes:
Data pipelines pulling user profiles, reward history, and engagement metrics
A training module that refreshes models weekly
A real-time inference API that can recommend next best actions for marketing emails
Marketing teams install the workflow and integrate the inference results into their campaign automation.
I continually refine the model and release updated versions, giving other teams immediate access to the latest data science advancements.

This ensures ADR employees can quickly find, create, share, and maintain the specialized workflows that drive real business value, all within the secure, private ecosystem of their internal All Digital Rewards platform.






You said:
Do we need more than the API docs and auth to sponsor all the services in the app?
ChatGPT
Reasoned about API docs and app services for a couple of seconds
Below is an overview of what might be needed‚Äîbeyond just the API docs and auth‚Äîto fully ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù or power all the services in the app. While API documentation and authentication credentials (e.g., keys, tokens) are crucial, there are several other components that typically come into play when building a robust internal application like the one described.

1. Data & Storage Requirements
Databases

Relational / NoSQL Database: To store project metadata, user info, workflow configs, marketplace listings, etc.
Vector Store (e.g., Qdrant): To store and retrieve embeddings for large language model (LLM) context, conversation history, or code snippets.
File / Blob Storage

If your app needs to handle binary files (e.g., reports, CSV exports, or images), you‚Äôll need a secure location (cloud buckets or on-premises storage).
ETL / Data Ingestion Pipelines

For pulling data from external or internal sources (like the reward redemption database at ADR), you might need specialized pipelines or microservices that handle data extract, transform, load processes.
2. Orchestration & Infrastructure
Microservices or Modular Architecture

If different parts of the app (marketplace, reporting, code generation, chat interface) run as separate services, you‚Äôll need infrastructure to orchestrate and discover these services.
Examples: Kubernetes, Docker Compose, or serverless functions with API gateways.
Scheduling & Job Queueing

For automatic or scheduled tasks (e.g., daily data pulls, repeated experiments), you‚Äôll likely need a job queue (like RabbitMQ, Celery, or AWS SQS/Lambda-based setups) and a scheduler (e.g., Airflow, Argo Workflows, or built-in cron-like functionality).
3. Security & Compliance
Secure Vault for Credentials

Storing sensitive credentials (API keys, DB passwords) in a secure system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault‚Äîrather than hardcoding them in code or config files.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Fine-grained permissioning system so that only certain roles can publish tools to the marketplace, others can install them, etc.
Possibly integrated with corporate Single Sign-On (SSO).
Audit Logging

A central logging service that keeps track of user actions, code changes, report generation, etc.
Compliance & Data Governance

If you‚Äôre handling personally identifiable information (PII) or payment data, you may need compliance with standards like SOC 2, PCI DSS, or GDPR. That often means additional processes for encryption, data retention, and auditing.
4. Front-End & DevOps Tooling
Front-End Framework & Build Pipeline

In addition to just having the endpoints (API docs) and tokens, you need a robust front-end build process (Webpack, Vite, Next.js build pipeline) for developing and deploying new UI features.
CI/CD Pipelines

Automated tests, linting, and deployment workflows for new code‚Äîespecially important if you‚Äôre generating code with AI tools.
Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins can be set up to verify code and deploy to staging/production environments.
Telemetry & Monitoring

Observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, etc.) to track performance, uptime, and error rates across all microservices.
5. Application Logic & Business Rules
LLM Orchestration / Fine-Tuning

If you‚Äôre using advanced reasoning or code generation (OpenAI‚Äôs o3, deepseek-coder, or custom fine-tuned models), you‚Äôll need:
Scripts or services that handle the prompt engineering, context retrieval (via vector store), and model output validation.
Potentially separate endpoints for different model tasks (chat vs. code generation vs. summarization).
Internal Business Logic Modules

For tasks like generating specialized reports, analyzing redemption patterns, or running marketing analytics, you might need domain-specific libraries or custom logic that goes beyond a single API call.
Versioning & Workflow Management

Tools for versioning user-generated workflows (like the ‚Äúdraft,‚Äù ‚Äúpublished,‚Äù ‚Äúdeprecated‚Äù states) so employees at ADR can safely update tools without breaking existing setups.
6. Corporate/Organizational Integration
Single Sign-On & Directory Services

If ADR uses Okta, Active Directory, or a corporate identity provider, you‚Äôll need to integrate your application‚Äôs auth layer with that system (OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect).
Internal Network / VPN Requirements

Some or all parts of the application may only be accessible behind an internal network or VPN for security purposes.
Departmental Billing or Budgeting

In some enterprise setups, if your marketplace concept involves cost centers or departmental billing, you may need a system to track usage and report cost by department.
In Summary
API Docs and Auth are absolutely core‚Äîthey define how external or internal clients authenticate and consume the services.
However, to run the entire application at scale‚Äîwith multi-role access, code generation, marketplace listings, scheduling, monitoring, etc.‚Äîyou typically need a comprehensive infrastructure that addresses:
Data storage (relational + vector)
Orchestration of services and tasks
Security (vaults, RBAC, audit logs)
DevOps toolchain (CI/CD, monitoring, versioning)
Application logic (business rules, workflows, code generation)
Corporate integration (SSO, compliance, departmental separation)
If your question is, ‚ÄúDo we need anything besides an API and authentication to power everything we‚Äôve envisioned?‚Äù then the answer is yes‚Äîthe above areas outline the additional infrastructure, services, and practices that come into play for a fully realized, enterprise-grade application.

I meant to preface that question with the step in the app when creating a new experiment and uploading our linking API docs i.e. rewardstack-api which is processed through the orchestrator and at this point in the process the API docs and other context from input embedded into vector store for the experiment such could be referenced as llm memory in stages of the experiment reasoning process. The Langgraph routes iterate through the API using o3 mini structured outputs suggesting how to use the API with tool creation the user views the tools the langgraph system wants to create for the user, user role should be enforced in rbac for access to sensitive tools and suggestions additionally requests to make sensitive tools would be blocked optionally ignored by an admin and grant access to them (must be complete list of possible tools given the context, 'available tools to create' and 'suggested ...') 
ChatGPT
Reasoned for a second
Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how the application can handle API documentation and context during the experiment creation process‚Äîhighlighting how the system references this data in LLM memory, iterates through potential API operations, and enforces role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive tools.

1. Starting a New Experiment with API Docs
User Action:

In the Experiment tab, the user uploads or links to the rewardstack-api (or any other API documentation).
They provide a short description of what they aim to achieve (e.g., ‚ÄúWe want to analyze reward transactions and generate weekly redemption reports.‚Äù).
System Action:

The application embeds the new context (API docs + user description) into the vector store (Qdrant).
This allows the LLM orchestrator (using the o3 reasoning model or a chain-of-thought approach) to reference the entire doc set during subsequent steps.
LLM Context Building:

The LangGraph orchestrator retrieves the relevant embeddings from Qdrant, merges them with user input (‚ÄúWe want to track weekly redemption stats‚Äù), and forms a comprehensive prompt for the LLM.
This prompt includes details about the recognized API endpoints, typical parameters, and possible workflows gleaned from the docs.
2. Iterating Through the API to Suggest Tools
LLM-Orchestrator Reasoning:

The o3 model interprets the user‚Äôs request and matches it against known operations in the API docs. For example:
GET /rewards ‚Üí for listing or searching rewards
GET /users/{id}/rewards ‚Üí for user-specific redemption data
POST /rewards/redeem ‚Üí to redeem or validate codes
It identifies possible tools that can be generated to fulfill the request (e.g., ‚ÄúReward Redemption Tracker,‚Äù ‚ÄúWeekly Aggregation Tool,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnalytics Dashboard Generator‚Äù).
Mini Structured Outputs (MSO):

The LLM may produce a structured plan (like JSON or a specialized format) describing the steps needed:
Tool #1: API connector to fetch redemption data
Tool #2: Transformation script to aggregate data by date range
Tool #3: Dashboard or report generator (e.g., PDF, web-based)
Each proposed tool includes minimal metadata (endpoint references, required parameters).
Tool List & Descriptions:

The system displays a list of ‚Äúpossible tools to create‚Äù and ‚Äúsuggested tools,‚Äù distinguishing between:
Core or ‚ÄúEssential‚Äù tools the user likely needs (e.g., data retrieval, aggregator).
Optional or ‚ÄúNice-to-have‚Äù tools (e.g., real-time alerts, advanced visualizations).
3. User Role Enforcement (RBAC) for Sensitive Tools
Role Checking:

As soon as the orchestrator suggests a list of possible tools, the system checks the user‚Äôs role (Campaign Manager, IT Admin, Finance, etc.) against an internal RBAC policy.
If some proposed tools access highly sensitive endpoints‚Äîlike ‚ÄúPOST /admin/awards‚Äù or ‚ÄúDELETE /rewards/{id}‚Äù‚Äîthe system flags these as restricted.
User Approval & Admin Overrides:

The user sees the list of suggested tools. Any tool that is beyond their permission level is either:
Blocked: Grayed out with a tooltip (‚ÄúRequires Admin Approval‚Äù).
Requestable: They can click ‚ÄúRequest Access,‚Äù prompting an admin to approve.
Admin roles can see all suggested tools, including sensitive ones, and can decide whether to enable them for the requesting user.
Security Policies:

Sensitive tools might require multi-factor approval if they deal with personal data or financial transactions.
Alternatively, the system might automatically ignore certain suggestions if the user‚Äôs role does not have the scope to handle them, or if ADR policy prohibits it.
4. Confirming the Tool Creation
User Interface:

The user sees each proposed tool in a modular card layout:
Tool Name: ‚ÄúReward Redemption Tracker.‚Äù
Description: ‚ÄúFetches user redemption data from rewardstack-api.‚Äù
Endpoints Used: ‚ÄúGET /rewards, GET /users/{id}/rewards.‚Äù
Access: Green checkmark if user has permission, or a padlock icon if restricted.
User Selection:

The user selects the tools they want to create or sets them to ‚ÄúNot needed.‚Äù
For blocked tools, they can optionally place a request for future access (‚ÄúRequest Admin Approval‚Äù).
Backend Generation:

The user clicks ‚ÄúCreate Tools.‚Äù
The LangGraph system calls the code generation service (deepseek-coder, o3, or sonnet-3.5) to produce boilerplate code.
The new code is saved in the user‚Äôs project repository under version control.
5. Iterating & Refining
Tool Configuration:

For each created tool, the user (or admin) configures auth tokens, schedule settings, or query filters.
The system checks again if the user has the right to see or edit certain fields (RBAC across config parameters).
Experiment Lifecycle:

The newly generated tools become part of the experiment. As the user runs it, the code might:
Pull data from the rewardstack-api.
Aggregate and produce a weekly report.
Optionally push results to a dashboard or Slack alert.
LLM Memory Utilization:

The system‚Äôs next iteration (e.g., ‚ÄúNow I want daily breakdowns instead of weekly‚Äù) can retrieve previous conversation context from the vector store.
The LLM can refine the existing tool rather than creating an entirely new one, if so instructed.
6. Complete Listing of ‚ÄúAvailable Tools to Create‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúSuggested Tools‚Äù
Available Tools

This might be a comprehensive set of workflows or endpoints that can be leveraged based on the uploaded API docs:
e.g., ‚ÄúGET /users,‚Äù ‚ÄúPOST /transactions,‚Äù ‚ÄúGET /analytics,‚Äù etc.
Not all are automatically recommended but are discoverable to the user (depending on role).
Suggested Tools

Tools the system deems most relevant based on user input and the reasoning model.
The user can quickly adopt these if they align with their goals.
If the orchestrator finds that some endpoints are extremely niche or advanced, they may not appear under ‚ÄúSuggestions,‚Äù but will still be in the ‚ÄúAvailable Tools‚Äù section for power users or admins.
Blocking or Hiding

For sensitive endpoints, the system might completely hide them from certain user roles (e.g., ‚ÄúDELETE /admin/financial-records‚Äù).
Alternatively, they might appear with a note: ‚ÄúNot accessible under your role,‚Äù giving them a chance to request access if needed.
7. Administrative Controls & Auditing
Admin View

Admins can see a ‚ÄúTool Request Queue,‚Äù which shows:
Who requested access to restricted tools
Which endpoints are involved
Justification or reason for the request
Admin can approve, deny, or set a time-limited access window.
Audit Logs

Every time the orchestrator suggests a tool, or a user requests creation of a sensitive tool, the event is recorded.
This ensures any unauthorized attempts (e.g., trying to bypass RBAC) can be traced.
Putting It All Together
User Initiates: ‚ÄúI want to create a new experiment analyzing rewards usage.‚Äù
Upload/Link API Docs: rewardstack-api docs.
LLM Orchestrator:
Reads docs, references vector store memory, proposes a set of potential tools (some might be restricted).
Returns a structured list: ‚ÄúRecommended Tools‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúOther Possible Tools.‚Äù
RBAC Filters:
The system compares each tool with the user‚Äôs role (e.g., Fraud Analyst, Campaign Manager).
Blocks or flags restricted endpoints.
User Sees Final Options:
Creates the allowed tools.
Requests access for any restricted tools.
Admin Approval:
Admin reviews the request, grants or denies.
If approved, the user can create that tool on a subsequent pass.
Code Generation & Configuration:
Tools are generated, stored, and configured in the user‚Äôs project.
The user sets schedules, parameters, or transformations.
Ongoing Iterations:
The system references LLM memory to refine or enhance existing tools in future steps, ensuring a continuous improvement loop.
Conclusion
By integrating the API docs and context into your vector store and leveraging LLM-based reasoning, the system can automatically propose relevant tools and endpoints. Adding RBAC ensures that sensitive operations are restricted or require admin approval.

Charting the documentation page

I‚Äôm piecing together the design for the documentation page, focusing on features like access control, interactive doc editing, Qdrant integration, data import/export, and usage monitoring. Progress is steady across these areas.

Below is a comprehensive design for the new Documentation page‚Äîyour third main page (in addition to Report Generation and Experiments). It integrates role-based access, version control, LLM-enhanced features, and import/export capabilities with Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Airtable.

Documentation Page Overview
Purpose

Provide a centralized location for all internal documentation (API docs, reward program details, user guides, etc.).
Leverage LLM capabilities‚Äîboth in normal mode for QA and in agent mode for live editing and improvement of the documentation.
Enforce RBAC (role-based access control) and version control akin to Git workflow, ensuring only authorized users can merge or finalize documentation changes.
Key Features

Role-Based Views and Permissions
LLM Chat (Normal Mode / Agent Mode)
Vector Store Integration (Qdrant) for knowledge base QA
Version Control & Merge Process (Admin privileges)
Export/Import options to Google Drive, Google Sheets, Airtable
Usage Monitoring for cost management (in Postgres or another DB)
1. Role-Based Access & Documentation Structure
User Roles & Permissions

Viewer: Can only view documentation (read-only).
Editor: Can propose changes, create new sections, use LLM in normal or agent mode, but must submit changes for admin review.
Admin: Can do everything‚Äîview, propose changes, and merge final edits into master documentation.
Documentation Directory

The Documentation page displays a directory tree or list of documents (topics, guides, reference files).
Each document node can have a role-based permission (e.g., some sections are restricted to Finance or IT only).
The hierarchy might look like:
javascript
Copy
Edit
Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ RewardStack API
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Authentication
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Error Handling
‚îú‚îÄ Internal Tools Overview
‚îî‚îÄ ... etc ...
Breadcrumb Navigation

A breadcrumb bar at the top helps users see where they are:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Home > Documentation > RewardStack API > Authentication
Clicking a breadcrumb returns the user to that level.
2. LLM Chat Interface
At the top or side of the Documentation page, you have a ChatGPT-like interface with two modes: Normal and Agent.

2.1 Normal Mode
Use Case

Question & Answer about the documentation.
The LLM can retrieve content from Qdrant (where the docs are embedded) to answer user queries in real time.
Workflow

User Types a Question (e.g., ‚ÄúHow do I authenticate with RewardStack API?‚Äù).
LLM queries the Qdrant vector store for relevant docs.
LLM composes an answer using the embedded knowledge.
User sees a textual answer plus references (like a short ‚ÄúSuggested docs: [Authentication.md, Endpoints.md]‚Äù).
Tools & Integration

The LLM can call a ‚ÄúSearch Documentation‚Äù tool or ‚ÄúBrowse Documentation Directory‚Äù function to find relevant sections.
No changes are made to the documentation in this mode‚Äîread-only from the user‚Äôs perspective.
2.2 Agent Mode
Use Case

Interactive Editing of documentation.
The LLM can propose or directly make changes to the doc text (like rewriting paragraphs, adding new sections) according to user instructions.
Workflow

User Types an Instruction
e.g., ‚ÄúRewrite the introduction to clarify how to generate an API token.‚Äù
LLM (Agent)
Uses ‚Äúedit documentation‚Äù tools to locate relevant sections in the documentation.
Potentially makes multiple ‚Äúfunction calls‚Äù to adjust text across different doc files.
Maintains an inner dialogue or chain-of-thought about changes (not all visible to the user).
User Approvals
The system displays a summary of proposed changes (like a diff or patch).
The user can accept or reject each individual change or choose ‚ÄúAccept All‚Äù or ‚ÄúReject All.‚Äù
Version Control

Changes are saved as commits in a local version branch for that user.
Only an Admin can merge the changes into the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù branch of the documentation.
This mimics a Git-like workflow:
Editor opens a ‚Äúpull request.‚Äù
Admin reviews and merges or requests further revisions.
Security

If the LLM attempts to edit restricted documents that the user‚Äôs role doesn‚Äôt allow, the system either:
Blocks the changes outright, or
Flags them for admin-only approval.
3. Vector Store Integration (Qdrant) Configuration
Configuration Panel

A settings or dropdown within the Documentation page chat UI:
‚ÄúConnect to Qdrant Collections‚Äù:
Checkboxes for main-doc-collection, api-collection, knowledge-base-collection, etc.
Choose LLM Model: Claude Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4, deepseek-coder, etc.
Multi-Collection Searches

Users with higher privileges can search across multiple Qdrant collections.
Viewers/Editors might only see the main docs, while Admin or specialized roles can see sensitive or private doc collections.
Flexible QA

The ‚ÄúNormal Mode‚Äù QA is powered by whichever collection(s) the user has toggled on.
The LLM only retrieves from the user‚Äôs permitted collections (RBAC for vector store data).
4. Version Control & Merge Process
Git-Like Commit & Branching

Each user effectively has a ‚Äúdoc editing branch.‚Äù
Proposed changes appear as a list of commits in a ‚Äúpull request‚Äù style interface.
Admin Merge

Admins see a ‚ÄúMerge Requests‚Äù tab or queue.
They can open each request, review a diff of changed docs, add comments, or merge.
Merging updates the official documentation, which is then re-embedded in Qdrant so the LLM can reference the new text.
Version History

A timeline of merges is visible in the doc‚Äôs history section: who changed what, and when.
Export to Google Drive

After a successful merge, the system can automatically sync or export updated docs to a shared Google Drive folder, ensuring an external backup or distribution copy.
Alternatively, a manual ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button can be used if admin wants to push a certain doc version.
5. Google Sheets & Airtable Integration
Data Import/Export

Within the Documentation page or a separate ‚ÄúTools‚Äù section, users can:
Import a table from Google Sheets or Airtable.
Export data (e.g., doc revision logs, usage metrics) to Google Sheets or Airtable for analysis.
Pre-Built Template Tool

A ‚ÄúTemplate Experiment‚Äù or ‚ÄúTool‚Äù that can:
Fetch data from Sheets/Airtable.
Use an LLM with memory to process or transform the data.
Export the results back, creating new sheets or records in Airtable.
Data Storage in Postgres

All usage data, cost logs, and user activity are stored in a dedicated Postgres table for monitoring.
This ensures the platform can track how often imports/exports are used and see any associated API costs for LLM calls, etc.
6. Usage & Cost Monitoring
Usage Dashboard

Displays how many LLM calls have been made by each user or department, including memory lookups from Qdrant.
Lists each tool or experiment run, how many tokens were used, and the associated cost.
Role-Based Cost Caps

Some roles might have a monthly budget for LLM queries or agent mode usage.
If they exceed usage, the system can throttle or request approval from an admin.
Detailed Logs

Each LLM request is logged with the user ID, timestamp, and approximate cost.
Allows the finance/IT teams to do internal chargeback or budgeting.
7. Putting It All Together: Example Flow
Editor Logs In

Navigates to Documentation from the main sidebar.
Sees the doc directory relevant to their role.
Normal Mode QA

Editor types a question: ‚ÄúHow do I get user rewards via the RewardStack API?‚Äù
LLM checks api-doc-collection in Qdrant, returns an answer referencing ‚ÄúGET /users/{id}/rewards‚Äù.
Switch to Agent Mode

Editor instructs the system: ‚ÄúPlease add an example request and response for the GET /users/{id}/rewards endpoint.‚Äù
LLM suggests changes in the documentation text.
Editor accepts the changes, which become local commits.
Admin Approval

An Admin sees a merge request in the doc‚Äôs ‚ÄúPending Changes.‚Äù
Admin reviews the new example snippet and merges it.
The official docs are updated, re-embedded in Qdrant for future queries.
Export

Admin clicks ‚ÄúExport to Google Drive‚Äù to save the updated docs externally.
Optionally, they also create a quick ‚ÄúUsage Data‚Äù spreadsheet in Google Sheets for reporting.
Cost Tracking

The system logs ~10 LLM calls for these interactions, attributing them to the Editor‚Äôs user ID.
The monthly usage is updated in Postgres, viewable in the ‚ÄúUsage Dashboard.‚Äù
Conclusion
With the Documentation page in place, your platform gains a powerful, LLM-driven environment for reading, editing, and managing internal docs. The combination of Normal and Agent modes covers both passive Q&A and active doc editing, while role-based permissions and a merge approval process ensure security and quality. Finally, integrations with Google Drive, Sheets, Airtable, and Postgres allow for seamless data flow, version control, and cost management‚Äîcreating a complete documentation workflow solution for All Digital Rewards (ADR).

Revamping with retriever pattern

I‚Äôm updating the design to include a retriever pattern that scans vector store collections chosen in the chat UI config, allowing public or private storage selection.

Below is a revised overview of how the Documentation page (the third main page) will integrate a retriever-based search for Q&A, incorporate role-based access tailored to ADR‚Äôs environment, and leverage multiple reasoning models (e.g., deepseek-reasoner, o1/-mini, o3/-mini) as part of a LangGraph-powered workflow. This design highlights new UI elements for selecting vector store collections and deciding whether chats are public or private.

1. Documentation Page: Role-Based Access & Structure
High-Level Navigation

The Documentation page remains one of the top-level areas (alongside ‚ÄúReport Generation‚Äù and ‚ÄúExperiments‚Äù).
Within Documentation, you have a directory/list of doc sections and a dedicated Chat UI for Q&A or editing.
ADR Roles & Access

Viewer: Read-only access to public docs; can also open Q&A chats but only with public data collections or their personal private space.
Editor: Can propose changes (Agent Mode), can read/write in certain doc sections, can choose from any vector store collections to which they have permission.
Admin: Full privileges (merge doc changes, access all vector collections, override or grant access to restricted docs).
Documentation Directory

Documents are arranged in a hierarchical or topic-based structure (RewardStack API, Internal Tools, etc.).
Each section has an access policy (e.g., ‚ÄúFinance docs are restricted to Finance role‚Äù).
Breadcrumbs at the top ensure easy navigation (e.g., Home > Documentation > RewardStack API).
2. Chat UI for Q&A (Retriever-Based)
2.1 Chat Initialization & Configuration
Chat Creation Modal

When the user clicks ‚ÄúNew Chat‚Äù (or ‚ÄúStart Chat‚Äù in the documentation page), a modal appears with:
Model/Agent Selection: Dropdown to pick from deepseek-reasoner, o1/-mini, or o3/-mini.
Collection Selection:
Checkboxes or a multi-select dropdown of Qdrant vector store collections (e.g., public-docs, finance-docs, api-docs, personal-private).
Only collections the user‚Äôs role can access are visible.
Chat Visibility:
A checkbox or toggle for ‚ÄúSave this chat in: Public or Private.‚Äù
If set to Public, other users with permission can see the conversation context. If Private, only the initiating user (and admins) can view it.
Retriever Setup

Once the user confirms the selection, the system constructs a Retriever pipeline referencing the chosen vector collections.
For each user query, the retriever will:
Perform a similarity search within all selected Qdrant collections.
Return the top-k relevant documents or doc sections.
RBAC Enforcement

If the user tries to select a restricted collection (like ‚Äúfinance-priv‚Äù without finance role), the UI either:
Hides it, or
Shows it as disabled with an optional ‚ÄúRequest Access‚Äù button.
2.2 Chat Modes & Reasoning Models
Normal Mode (Q&A / Read-Only)

The selected model (e.g., deepseek-reasoner) uses the retrieved documents to answer user questions.
No writing or modifying of the doc text occurs.
The LLM can produce references to relevant doc sections, courtesy of the retriever‚Äôs metadata.
Agent Mode (Editing / Write)

The selected model (e.g., o3/-mini for structured outputs) can call an ‚ÄúEdit Documentation‚Äù tool.
The LLM can propose changes, referencing doc pages from the retriever.
Inner Dialogue (chain-of-thought) is used to plan or chain function calls, though only the final ‚Äúdiff‚Äù is shown to the user.
The user can accept or reject each proposed change.
If accepted, those changes become commits in the user‚Äôs branch, subject to an admin merge if final.
o3 Model and Structured Outputs

In Agent Mode, the o3 model can return structured JSON describing each doc section to be edited, the line numbers or paragraph IDs, and the new content.
This structured approach allows for a smoother ‚Äúdiff‚Äù display in the UI, so users can easily see exactly what changes are proposed.
3. Version Control & Merge Process
Git-Like Workflow

As before, all changes from Agent Mode are stored in a user-specific branch.
An Editor can keep editing or invite an Admin to review.
The Admin sees a ‚ÄúMerge Requests‚Äù queue in the Documentation page, reviews diffs, and merges if approved.
Saving Chats

If the user chose ‚ÄúSave chat as Public‚Äù, the conversation is embedded into a shared vector store or logged for future reference.
If Private, it‚Äôs only stored in their personal vector collection. An admin can still override for compliance reasons.
Automatic Re-Embedding

After a successful merge, the updated doc text is re-embedded into the relevant Qdrant collection(s).
Future queries to the retriever reflect the newly updated docs.
4. Additional Functionality
4.1 Export/Import Integration
Google Drive Sync

Admin can export updated doc sections to Google Drive.
Automatic or manual triggers are possible (e.g., ‚ÄúExport on every successful merge‚Äù or ‚ÄúExport on demand‚Äù).
Google Sheets / Airtable Import & Export

Users can open a Tools or Data panel to import data from Google Sheets / Airtable into the doc or embed it into Qdrant.
An out-of-the-box template experiment can fetch from Sheets/Airtable, use the LLM to clean or transform data, then produce new docs or a structured summary.
4.2 Usage Monitoring
All LLM calls, including those for Normal QA or Agent Editing, are logged.
The system tracks which roles used which models and how many tokens or calls were consumed.
Postgres stores usage data for cost management.
RBAC or monthly usage caps can be applied based on user roles.
5. What Features Are ‚ÄúReady‚Äù for the Documentation Page?
Role-Based View & Edit

Documentation sections each have a permission set, so only the right roles see or edit them.
Configurable Retriever

On chat creation, the user picks which Qdrant collection(s) to query, respecting RBAC constraints.
Public/Private Chat Storage

A user can decide whether to store the conversation in a public or private collection, offering flexible knowledge sharing or personal note-keeping.
Multiple Reasoning Models

deepseek-reasoner, o1/-mini, and o3/-mini can all be chosen at chat initiation, each with unique capabilities:
deepseek-reasoner ‚Üí general Q&A
o1/-mini ‚Üí lightweight reasoning
o3/-mini ‚Üí advanced structured outputs for Agent Mode editing
Agent Mode with Structured Outputs

The o3 model can produce structured edits that the user can selectively accept or reject, with changes tracked in a branch.
Diff & Merge Workflow

The doc editing process is fully versioned. Admin approval is needed for merges, ensuring quality control.
Export to Google Drive, Import/Export from Sheets/Airtable

Ready-made integration points allow doc or data workflows to sync externally, supporting more collaborative or reporting needs outside the internal system.
Usage & Cost Tracking

The documentation page ties into the same usage monitoring pipeline as the rest of the app, ensuring consistent cost tracking for LLM queries and data retrieval.
Conclusion
This revised Documentation Page design leverages a retriever-based QA system for searching user-selected Qdrant collections, enforces role-based security for each doc, and provides Normal and Agent modes via multiple reasoning models (deepseek-reasoner, o1/-mini, o3/-mini). By offering public/private chat storage, structured outputs for doc editing, and a version control workflow, your app ensures both flexibility and security in managing ADR‚Äôs extensive internal knowledge base.

Crafting the wireframe

I‚Äôm outlining the design of a UI wireframe, focusing on layout, navigation, usability, and responsive design. Mentioning design tools, user flows, color palette, and consistent style.

Crafting wireframe specifics

I‚Äôm detailing the layout, navigation, and design elements of the UI wireframe, including role-based aspects, minimal approach, and standard enterprise layout using a user-centered design process.

Below is a high-level look at how we approached UI wireframing for the entire project‚Äîcovering navigation, layout strategy, role-based visibility, and styling consistency. It highlights best practices we used to ensure a clean, modern interface that ties together the Report Generation, Experiments, Marketplace, and Documentation pages.

1. Design Process & Tools
User-Centric Design

We started by gathering requirements from different user roles (Campaign Managers, Finance Officers, IT Admins, etc.).
Identified the core tasks each role performs (e.g., generating reports, editing documentation, installing tools).
Converted these requirements into user flows and low-fidelity wireframes to validate with stakeholders.
Wireframing Tools

Created the initial low-fidelity sketches using a tool like Figma or Sketch.
Iterated on feedback and evolved wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes, adding branding elements and interactive hotspots.
Iterative Feedback Loop

Conducted quick user tests or stakeholder reviews on each milestone.
Adjusted layout, labeling, or feature grouping based on real-world usage scenarios.
2. Global Layout & Navigation
Top Navigation Bar

Logo & Project Name on the far left, always clickable for a quick return to the home dashboard.
Search Bar or global search icon near the center or right, allowing quick queries across Projects, Experiments, Documentation, and Marketplace.
User Profile & Settings on the far right, housing role info, account settings, and logout.
Left Sidebar / Collapsible Menu

Primary sections:
Home / Dashboard
Report Generation
Experiments
Documentation
Marketplace
Admin (RBAC) (visible only to Admin roles)
Collapsible behavior: On narrow screens, it transitions to an icon-based menu to save space.
Breadcrumbs

Appear beneath the top nav when diving into nested content (e.g., Home > Projects > [ProjectName] > ...).
Each breadcrumb link is clickable, letting users quickly navigate back.
Responsive Design

We used responsive breakpoints to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, or large mobile devices).
Key elements (nav bars, content panels) rearrange or collapse gracefully.
3. Page-by-Page Layout Notes
3.1 Report Generation Page
Overview: Displays existing reports, scheduling options, and quick-start templates.
List View: Each report has a card with essential info (title, date last generated, status).
Create New Report: A modal or dedicated form with dropdowns for data sources, date range pickers, and optional custom fields.
Role-Based Views: Non-admins see only their own or shared reports; admins see organization-wide reports.
3.2 Experiments Page
Experiment List: A table or card view showing ongoing experiments, each with status (Draft, Active, Completed).
New Experiment: A brief wizard or modal where users input a URL, API docs link, or a short description.
Step-by-Step Config: Once created, a tabbed or accordion interface (Data Source, Tools, Scheduling) helps the user configure further details.
Side Panel: Summaries of the selected experiment‚Äôs key info (runs, last success/fail, logs).
3.3 Marketplace Page
Two-Column Layout: Left side for search & filters (categories, free vs. paid, department tags); right side shows tool listings.
Tool Cards: Title, short description, version, rating (if applicable).
Tool Details: Clicking a card opens a detail view with screenshots, permissions needed, version history, and install/upgrade buttons.
RBAC: Tools that are restricted (e.g., Finance-only) are either hidden or show a padlock/‚Äúrequest access‚Äù button.
3.4 Documentation Page
Doc Directory / List: On the left, a hierarchical tree or categorized list of doc sections.
Main Content Panel: Displays the doc text, with an Edit or Agent Mode button (if the user has edit rights).
Chat UI Pane: Either a slide-out panel or a dedicated zone for the LLM-based chat.
Model & Collection Selector: A small form at the top with dropdowns (‚ÄúSelect Vector Collection(s)‚Äù, ‚ÄúChoose Model‚Äù).
Public/Private Chat Toggle: Checkboxes to mark whether the conversation is visible to others.
Commit & Merge Flow: A ‚ÄúPending Changes‚Äù alert or tab appears when the user has unmerged doc edits.
4. Role-Based Visibility & States
RBAC Highlights

Certain buttons or pages are visible only to specific roles (e.g., ‚ÄúAdmin,‚Äù ‚ÄúEditor,‚Äù ‚ÄúViewer‚Äù).
If a Viewer tries to access an editor feature, we show a disabled button or a prompt: ‚ÄúYou do not have permission‚Äîrequest access or contact admin.‚Äù
Minimal / Modular UI

Each role sees only the relevant functionality, reducing clutter.
For instance, a Finance Officer might see ‚ÄúFinance Tools‚Äù or ‚ÄúFinance Docs,‚Äù while a Campaign Manager sees ‚ÄúMarketing Tools‚Äù or ‚ÄúCampaign Docs.‚Äù
Color & Visual Cues

We used subtle color coding or icons to distinguish restricted vs. freely accessible content.
Lock icons for restricted items, lighter/darker backgrounds for admin-only sections.
5. Style Consistency & Visual Design
Design System

We established a small, consistent palette‚Äîa primary color for clickable elements, a secondary color for highlights, and neutrals for backgrounds.
A shared typography scale (e.g., H1, H2, Body text) to maintain readability and brand consistency.
Iconography

Simple, monoline icons for navigation items (Reports, Experiments, Tools, Docs).
Lock or shield icons for restricted features.
A familiar ‚Äúchat bubble‚Äù icon for the LLM chat interface.
Button Styles

Primary Button for main actions (e.g., ‚ÄúCreate,‚Äù ‚ÄúInstall,‚Äù ‚ÄúSave‚Äù), using the brand‚Äôs main color.
Secondary Button for less critical actions (e.g., ‚ÄúCancel,‚Äù ‚ÄúView More‚Äù).
Disabled State is visually distinct (grayed out, lower opacity).
Whitespace & Hierarchy

Generous whitespace around content blocks to keep a clean look.
Clear section headings, subheadings, and dividing lines for scannability.
6. Wireframe-to-Prototype Progression
Low-Fidelity Sketches

Focused on layout (where is the nav bar, how big is the side panel?), user flow, and major interaction points.
High-Fidelity & Interactions

Defined color palette, typography, icon set.
Created interactive demos (hover states, modals, transitions) to replicate real usage.
Integration Testing

Each UI module was tested with placeholder data.
Verified that role-based restrictions worked properly (e.g., Editor sees an ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button, Viewer does not).
7. Lessons & Best Practices
Less Is More

We intentionally kept each page minimal‚Äîfocusing on the user‚Äôs immediate tasks without excess clutter.
Modular elements (cards, lists, sidebars) are reused across the app for consistency.
Consistency in Navigation

The same top nav and side nav patterns are maintained across Reports, Experiments, Marketplace, and Documentation.
Breadcrumbs appear wherever content is nested multiple levels deep.
Flexible & Extensible

The wireframes and design system account for future expansions (e.g., adding new user roles, extra doc categories, or new LLM tools).
We used a component-based approach to ensure adding new forms or lists remains straightforward.
Conclusion
By nailing down the UI wireframes with a clear navigation structure, consistent design language, and role-based page states, we‚Äôve created an interface that is both intuitive and scalable. Leveraging an iterative design approach ensured the final layout meets the real-world needs of various ADR roles, while maintaining a polished, modern look and feel.

Mapping out the realization

I‚Äôm piecing together the backend for ADR using a design system, backend architecture, and API integration, ensuring a seamless connection with the UI.

Below is a detailed, behind-the-scenes look at how we wireframed the UI for ADR‚Äôs new application and how we‚Äôre translating those designs into concrete backend functionality. This encapsulates the entire process‚Äîfrom initial sketches to production-ready services and integrations.

1. UI Wireframing: Step-by-Step
1.1 Gathering Requirements & Personas
Stakeholder Interviews: We met with the ADR team (Campaign Managers, IT Admins, Finance Officers, etc.) to identify core tasks.
User Flows & Personas: Mapped out typical user journeys (e.g., ‚ÄúCreate a new experiment,‚Äù ‚ÄúEdit documentation,‚Äù ‚ÄúInstall a marketplace tool‚Äù) to ensure the wireframes would reflect real needs.
1.2 Low-Fidelity Sketches (Paper or Whiteboard)
Sketch Key Screens:
Dashboard/Home: Quick links to major sections (Reports, Experiments, Documentation, etc.).
Experiments: Listing, creation process (wizard or modal).
Documentation: Directory layout, integrated LLM chat panel (normal mode vs. agent mode).
Marketplace: Tool listings, search/filter, detail page.
Focus on Layout: We pinned down the main nav bar, sidebar sections, and how breadcrumbs would appear without worrying about colors or fonts yet.
1.3 Mid-Fidelity Wireframes (Figma/Sketch)
Component Library: Created a handful of reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, table layouts).
Basic Interactions: Showed how modals open, how sidebars collapse, and how a user steps through an ‚ÄúExperiment creation‚Äù wizard.
Feedback Cycles: Quick user tests or stakeholder reviews to confirm navigation flow and that each role sees the correct features.
1.4 High-Fidelity Prototypes
Branding & Style: Incorporated ADR‚Äôs color palette, typography, and any brand guidelines.
Interactive Elements: Links that mimic real transitions, form fields with placeholders, a mock chat UI.
Role-Based Variants: Demonstrated how the UI changes when viewed as an Admin vs. a Viewer or Editor.
1.5 Final Wireframe Documentation
Annotated Screens: Each wireframe screen includes notes on user interactions, business logic triggers, and relevant APIs or services the screen calls.
User Flow Diagrams: Flowcharts showing how a user might navigate from the Dashboard to an Experiment‚Äôs detailed page, or from Documentation chat to the version control merges.
2. Bridging Wireframes to Backend Reality
Once the UI vision was clear, we planned the backend architecture and integration points to support every feature revealed in the wireframes.

2.1 Architectural Overview
Microservices or Modular Monolith

We decided on a service-oriented approach, so each domain (Experiments, Documentation, Marketplace, etc.) can scale independently or be developed in parallel.
Services speak to each other via a REST or GraphQL API gateway, depending on complexity.
Data Storage

SQL/NoSQL: A relational DB (Postgres) stores user profiles, roles, project metadata, usage logs, etc.
Vector Store (Qdrant): Manages embeddings for LLM-based search and memory.
File Storage: For storing actual documentation files or versioned text, we either rely on the DB or a separate object storage (like an S3 bucket) to handle larger files.
Authentication & RBAC

We use OAuth2 / SSO with ADR‚Äôs identity provider.
A role-based permissions layer ensures certain endpoints (like ‚Äúmerge doc changes‚Äù or ‚Äúedit finance docs‚Äù) are accessible only to admins or specific roles.
LLM Services

A dedicated ‚ÄúLangGraph‚Äù orchestrator service that calls models such as:
deepseek-reasoner: For general Q&A.
o1/-mini: For lightweight tasks.
o3/-mini: For structured outputs, especially in agent mode.
This orchestrator handles prompt building, context retrieval from Qdrant, and function calls for code generation or doc editing.
2.2 Backend Endpoints & Functional Mapping
For each wireframed page or feature, we identified the corresponding backend endpoints:

Experiments

GET /experiments: List existing experiments (with filters like user ownership, status).
POST /experiments: Create a new experiment (the wizard steps are orchestrated on the frontend, but each step calls the backend to store partial data).
PUT /experiments/{id}: Update experiment parameters (e.g., scheduling, integrated tools).
POST /experiments/{id}/run: Trigger a manual run or test.
Documentation

GET /docs: Fetch doc listings (apply RBAC checks to show only relevant docs).
POST /docs/{docId}/edit: Proposed changes from the LLM or user. Stored as a ‚Äúbranch‚Äù or pending changeset.
POST /docs/merge: Admin merges changes to master.
POST /docs/search: A specialized route that triggers a Qdrant vector search (for normal mode Q&A).
POST /docs/agent-actions: In agent mode, the LLM calls a function to edit docs, which the backend logs for approval.
Marketplace

GET /marketplace: List tools/workflows.
POST /marketplace/install: User installs a selected tool into their project.
POST /marketplace/publish: Upload or share a new tool (admin can moderate).
Report Generation

GET /reports: Summaries of existing reports.
POST /reports: Create a new report definition.
PUT /reports/{reportId}/schedule: Set or update the scheduling for automated runs.
POST /reports/{reportId}/run: Force a manual run.
LLM / Chat

POST /chat/session: Start a new chat session, specifying model and vector collections.
POST /chat/message: Send user query ‚Üí orchestrator ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí result is returned (with references).
POST /chat/save: Decide if chat is private or public (the system saves embeddings in the appropriate vector store).
2.3 Connecting the Dots: How a Wireframed Screen Ties to Backend Logic
Example: ‚ÄúNew Experiment‚Äù Wizard Step

Frontend: The user enters a URL or API doc link, selects a timeline, picks recommended tools.
Backend:
POST /experiments with the basic metadata.
The orchestrator might parse the API doc, embed it in Qdrant, then call the o3/-mini model to generate tool suggestions.
The user sees a list of suggested tools in the wireframed UI.
Upon confirmation, the backend saves the chosen tools as part of the experiment config.
3. Making It All Real: Implementation Phases
3.1 Phase 1: Foundations
Repo Setup: Create a monorepo or multiple repos for each service.
DB & Vector Store: Stand up Postgres, Qdrant. Create migrations for user tables, roles, doc tables, etc.
Authentication & RBAC: Implement OAuth2 with ADR‚Äôs SSO. Add middleware for role checks.
3.2 Phase 2: Core Features
Experiment Service: Basic CRUD for experiments plus minimal LLM calls.
Documentation Service: Basic retrieval of docs, version control logic for merges.
LLM Orchestrator: Ties into external or local LLM endpoints (deepseek, o1/-mini, o3/-mini), handles vector store queries.
3.3 Phase 3: Advanced Integrations
Agent Mode in Documentation: Implement an ‚Äúedit doc‚Äù function with approval flows.
Marketplace: Tool listings, install/publish flows.
Report Generation: Scheduling, custom data pipelines, PDF or dashboard outputs.
3.4 Phase 4: Polish & Scalability
UI Enhancements: Refine design, optimize for performance (lazy-loading large doc sets, partial retrieval).
Monitoring & Logging: Central logs for LLM usage, cost metrics, user activity.
Security Hardening: Penetration tests, least-privilege checks for each microservice.
4. The Wireframe + Backend Feedback Cycle
Wireframe Demo

Show the relevant wireframe to the team, simulate the user clicking through.
When the user triggers an action (e.g., installing a tool), we specify exactly which API is called, what data is exchanged, and what the user sees next.
Backend Stub

We create mock endpoints or ‚Äústubs‚Äù returning placeholder JSON that match the wireframe‚Äôs expected structure.
The front-end devs integrate these stubs, verifying that the flow is correct.
Incremental Integration

Once the stub is stable, the backend team implements real logic (DB queries, calls to the orchestrator or external services).
The front-end is updated to handle real data, error states, role constraints, etc.
User Acceptance Testing

We have ADR staff with specific roles (e.g., Finance role vs. Admin role) test the UI to confirm they see the correct docs, the correct tools, and can‚Äôt do restricted actions.
5. Final Thoughts & Best Practices
Parallel Front-End & Back-End Development

The wireframes and the final Figma prototypes act as the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for front-end devs.
The back-end team references the same designs to expose properly named endpoints and data structures.
Consistent Documentation

Each endpoint is documented in an OpenAPI/Swagger file, ensuring the front-end devs know exactly how to integrate.
The design specs from wireframes remain in sync with the API docs.
Tight Feedback Loop

Regular check-ins ensure the UI stays aligned with backend capabilities.
If the back-end hits a technical constraint, we revisit wireframes to refine or simplify.
Scalable, Future-Proof

By decoupling the UI from the back-end via well-defined APIs, the application can evolve (e.g., switching to new LLM models or adding new marketplace features) without requiring a total rewrite.
Conclusion
The wireframing process at ADR was both holistic (covering user roles, flows, branding) and iterative (small steps of validation and refinement). Mapping each wireframe screen to precise backend endpoints ensures clarity between front-end and back-end teams. By following a service-oriented approach and carefully documenting every integration step, we‚Äôre able to bring the entire UI vision‚Äîreport generation, experiments, documentation editing, marketplace, and beyond‚Äîto production reality in a maintainable, scalable way.

Here's the complete integration guide for Rewardstack's authentication system with Next.js:

# Rewardstack Auth Integration Guide

## 1. Roles and Permissions Structure
**Defined Roles** (from data.model.ts):
typescript
export const Roles = {
  superadmin: ['organization.all', 'program.all', 'participant.all', 'report.all'],
  admin: ['organization.write', 'program.write', 'participant.read'],
  configs: ['organization.config', 'program.config'],
  reports: ['report.generate', 'data.export'],
  accounting: ['transactions.read', 'payments.process'],
  participant_view: ['participant.read'],
  csr: ['participant.manage', 'cases.resolve']
};


## 2. Next.js Implementation

### Auth Provider Component
typescript
// context/AuthProvider.tsx
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { parseJwt } from '../utils/auth';

interface AuthContextType {
  user: any;
  login: () => void;
  logout: () => void;
  hasPermission: (scope: string, action?: string) => boolean;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType>(null!);

export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null);

  const login = () => {
    window.location.href = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL}/oauth/google?redirect=${encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)}`;
  };

  const logout = () => {
    localStorage.removeItem('rewardstack_token');
    setUser(null);
  };

  const hasPermission = (scope: string, action?: string) => {
    if (!user) return false;
    return user.scopes.some((s: string) => {
      const [sScope, sAction] = s.split('.');
      return sScope === scope && (!action || sAction === action || sAction === 'all');
    });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('rewardstack_token');
    if (token) {
      try {
        const decoded = parseJwt(token);
        setUser(decoded.user);
      } catch (error) {
        localStorage.removeItem('rewardstack_token');
      }
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout, hasPermission }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);


### API Route Handler
typescript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { code } = req.query;
  
  // Exchange authorization code for token
  const response = await fetch(`${process.env.AUTH_SERVER}/api/auth/oauth/exchange`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': process.env.API_KEY!
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ code })
  });

  const { token } = await response.json();
  
  // Set token in localStorage through cookie
  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', `rewardstack_token=${token}; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax`);
  res.redirect('/dashboard');
}


## 3. Environment Configuration

### .env.local
ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
AUTH_SERVER=http://localhost:4200
API_KEY=local_dev_key


### .env.production
ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/auth
AUTH_SERVER=https://admin.adrqa.info
API_KEY=prod_key_123


### next.config.js
javascript
module.exports = {
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    authUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL,
  },
  serverRuntimeConfig: {
    authServer: process.env.AUTH_SERVER,
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY
  }
};


## 4. Usage in Components

### Protected Route
typescript
// components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthProvider';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function ProtectedRoute({ children, requiredPermission }: { 
  children: React.ReactNode,
  requiredPermission?: string
}) {
  const { user, hasPermission } = useAuth();
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user) {
      router.push('/login');
    } else if (requiredPermission && !hasPermission(...requiredPermission.split('.'))) {
      router.push('/unauthorized');
    }
  }, [user, requiredPermission]);

  return <>{user ? children : null}</>;
}


### Example Page Usage
typescript
// pages/dashboard.tsx
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthProvider';
import ProtectedRoute from '../components/ProtectedRoute';

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { user, logout } = useAuth();

  return (
    <ProtectedRoute requiredPermission="participant.read">
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome, {user?.name}</h1>
        <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        {/* Content based on permissions */}
      </div>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
}


## 5. Key Security Features

1. **JWT Validation** (replicating login.service.ts logic):
typescript
// utils/auth.ts
export function parseJwt(token: string) {
  try {
    const base64Url = token.split('.')[1];
    const base64 = base64Url.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    const jsonPayload = decodeURIComponent(
      atob(base64)
        .split('')
        .map(c => '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2))
        .join('')
    );
    return JSON.parse(jsonPayload);
  } catch (e) {
    return null;
  }
}


2. **Role-Based Components**:
typescript
// components/RBAC.tsx
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthProvider';

export const RBAC = ({ children, scope, action }: { 
  children: React.ReactNode,
  scope: string,
  action?: string 
}) => {
  const { hasPermission } = useAuth();
  return hasPermission(scope, action) ? <>{children}</> : null;
};

// Usage:
<RBAC scope="participant" action="write">
  <EditParticipantButton />
</RBAC>


This implementation maintains the security model from the original Angular codebase while adapting it to Next.js best practices. The environment configuration allows easy switching between development, QA, and production environments while preserving the RBAC structure defined in Rewardstack's core system.

Assessing project needs

The user is looking to integrate Rewardstack's authentication with Next.js, considering its application in a broader ADR system that includes roles, experiments, and documentation.

Crafting the response

I‚Äôm preparing a response that includes a short summary or final thoughts on integrating the Rewardstack authentication system with Next.js, as the user has provided a code snippet.

Below is a concise recap of the Rewardstack authentication integration approach for Next.js, along with a few best-practice suggestions on how to adapt it into the broader All Digital Rewards (ADR) platform context (roles, experiments, doc editing, etc.). If you‚Äôre simply looking for a final confirmation that the guide is complete and correct, you can consider this a final ‚Äústamp‚Äù of approval. Otherwise, these notes can help you see how it fits into a larger, role-based environment.

Recap of the Integration Guide
Role & Scope Definitions

A Roles structure in data.model.ts maps each role (e.g., superadmin, admin, csr, etc.) to an array of permissions (e.g., organization.all, participant.manage, etc.).
This concept parallels Angular or NestJS usage but is now leveraged in Next.js via a simple hasPermission utility.
AuthProvider (React Context)

Stores a user object (parsed from rewardstack_token).
Implements login (redirects to an OAuth flow) and logout (clears token).
Provides hasPermission(scope, action) so any component can check if the current user can do a particular operation.
Exchange Token API Route

A custom Next.js API route (/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts) which receives an OAuth code, calls the external Rewardstack auth server to exchange for a JWT, and sets a browser cookie (or localStorage) for subsequent app usage.
ProtectedRoute & RBAC

Example: A ProtectedRoute component that redirects users if they are either:
Not logged in, or
Lacking the required permission (like participant.read).
The RBAC component can optionally hide or show UI elements based on the same permission checks.
Environment Variables & Config

.env.local and .env.production define NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL, AUTH_SERVER, and API_KEY so you can easily switch between dev, staging, and prod.
Security & JWT Validation

Basic parseJwt method to decode and store user info from the token.
A realistic production environment might add deeper validations (signature checks, expiration checks) server-side, but this is a good start.
Adapting to the ADR Platform
The guide shows how to port Rewardstack‚Äôs existing RBAC logic into a Next.js setting. For the All Digital Rewards environment‚Äîwhere you have robust roles (Viewer, Editor, Admin, etc.) plus advanced functionalities (report generation, experiments, documentation editing)‚Äîthe same structure can be extended or merged with your existing:

Role Definitions

Either reuse Roles from data.model.ts, or map them to your new ADR-specific roles (‚Äúreport.generate,‚Äù ‚Äúexperiment.manage,‚Äù etc.).
If ADR roles differ from Rewardstack‚Äôs, unify them or do a crosswalk (like ‚Äúrewardstack‚Äôs csr ‚Üí ADR‚Äôs participant.manage role‚Äù).
Granular Permissions

As you add more fine-grained features (e.g., ‚Äúdoc.edit‚Äù in Agent Mode, ‚Äúdoc.merge‚Äù for Admin), just define new permission strings and include them in the relevant roles.
Multi-Tenant or Multi-Service

If your ADR platform has multiple microservices, you may expand the token exchange logic to call different backends.
You could also unify everything behind a single identity provider (IDP), which issues JWTs recognized by multiple services (Rewardstack, ADR experiments, etc.).
Securing the LLM / Agent Features

If your platform uses LLM-based code generation or doc editing, simply wrap those calls in hasPermission checks (e.g., only users with doc.write can invoke certain agent functions).
API Gateway Approach

You can place all user authentication flows in a single Next.js ‚ÄúAuth‚Äù module or rely on a dedicated Node/Express gateway. The example route handler for /api/auth/[...nextauth].ts can be extended to handle additional checks or multi-step flows.
Key Takeaways / Best Practices
Keep It Simple: The code snippet already neatly decodes the token client-side and checks roles. This is enough for many internal or B2B apps.
Server-Side Validation: For production, consider verifying the token‚Äôs signature on the server (via jsonwebtoken or a custom check) rather than relying purely on client-side parsing.
RBAC Patterns: The approach in hasPermission(scope, action) is flexible. You can expand it if you need hierarchical roles or time-based tokens (like session expiration).
Consistent Env Setup: The .env.local and .env.production usage is standard for Next.js. Ensure secrets (like API_KEY) never leak into NEXT_PUBLIC_... environment variables, which can be exposed in client-side code.
Conclusion
The integration guide for Rewardstack‚Äôs auth system with Next.js is ready to roll as is. You can seamlessly fold it into your ADR platform by aligning roles, permissions, and the token exchange logic with your existing architecture. With a little polish (e.g., adding server-side token validation and mapping ADR roles to Rewardstack roles), you‚Äôll have a secure and role-aware Next.js application that can scale alongside your reward, experiment, and documentation workflows.
